          An app built using AWS boto3 for backend and streamlit for frontend to give us details about our AWS account.

          The tool gave an overview about cost usage, quota reports, and resource specific reports such as filter old EC2, unattached EBS, unused EIP (EIP with no traffic) etc.
          The app also gave option to cleanup resources based on reports generated.
